# Pir Pur
Pir Pur is a turn-based Roguelite with combat system inspired by the Disciples series.
Defeat all enemies with a team of weird creatures.

This individual project was the main part of the 'Programming games in Unity' course
during 5th semester of Computer Science studies at Warsaw Univesity of Life Sciences in 2022.

This was my first ever attempt at making a functioning video game.

Combat environment prefabs from Asset Store, other assets made by me.

==================================

Installation:

Download the build from: https://wisent.itch.io/pirpur

OR

Use uploaded files to create your own Unity project and build the game

==================================

Controls:

- Left Mouse Button - Menu Buttons / Attack Selected Unit
- Right Mouse Button - Inspect


Win/Lose Conditions:

- Run is won when all enemy teams have been defeated.
- Run is lost after losing any fight.


Adventure Map:

- You can choose any combination of all 3 units at the start of the run.
- You may inspect units with Right Mouse Button
- After that you'll be asked to choose one of the enemy encounters marked with an 'X'
- You can use Right Mouse Button to check lineups of enemy teams
- Each battle won rewards player with a new unit


Combat:

- You can rearrange your team on Adventure Map or directly before starting combat
- Units attack one time per turn, with order based on their speed
- Each unit has a different type of attack:
	*'Ranged' units can attack any single enemy on the field
	*'All' units attack all enemies
	*'Melee' units can only target adjacent enemies
- 'Wait' command delays unit's attack until the end of turn
- 'Defend' give 50% damage reduction until unit's next turn
- Damaged units are fully healed after combat. Dead units are lost.
- All units deal up to 5 random bonus damage on each attack


Tips:

- Try to spread out enemy damage to avoid casualties
- Try to focus down single units to lower enemy's damage output
- Try to maintain healthy balance of melee and ranged units
- Scout all enemy teams before attacking to better adjust reward choice
- Attacking the smallest enemy team is usually, but not always the best choice

Have Fun
